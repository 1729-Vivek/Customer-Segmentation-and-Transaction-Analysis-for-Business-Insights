# Customer Segmentation using K-Means and DBSCAN Clustering

This project demonstrates customer segmentation using two popular clustering algorithms: K-Means and DBSCAN. The dataset used is from an online retail store, and the project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, clustering, and result visualization.

## Project Overview

Customer segmentation is a crucial task in understanding and catering to diverse customer needs. By segmenting customers, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue. In this project, we analyze customer purchasing behaviors using clustering techniques.

### Key Features:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, feature selection, and date-time conversion.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creation of relevant features like total bill size and purchase intervals.
- **Clustering Techniques**: Implementation of K-Means for identifying customer groups and DBSCAN for detecting noise and denser regions.
- **Visualization**: Graphical representation of clusters and their characteristics.

## Dataset

The dataset is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository and contains transactional data for an online retail store. Each row in the dataset represents a transaction, including features like `InvoiceNo`, `StockCode`, `Description`, `Quantity`, `InvoiceDate`, `UnitPrice`, `CustomerID`, and `Country`.
